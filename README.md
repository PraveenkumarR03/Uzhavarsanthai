This software helps both teachers and students. By this the teachers can conduct exams, schedule exams and evaluate the students answers. The students can write exams in the assigned time and view their marks. The exams can be either mcq based or question-answer type. In this random exam code will be generated to write the exam. Login ID for both teachers and students can be created.
